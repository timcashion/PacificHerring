<h1><span class="header-section-number">9</span> Going forward: A look into closing the roe herring fishery</h1>
<p>Pacific Wild asked the author to consider a temporary closure of the fishery with the aim of protecting the ecosystem as herring plays an important role in many of its predators’ diets. This closure has been proposed to rebuild herring stocks and protect the species that rely upon herring in this ecosystem. The following details options based on previous experience of temporary fishery closures and licence buy-backs in Canada.</p>
<p>The first example will draw directly from the BC herring fishery. In recent years, the roe herring fishery has had quota assigned to fishing areas where a fishery opening did not occur <span class="citation">(Government of Canada 2014)</span>. Many fishers had purchases licences for these areas prior to the fishery opening and were not allowed to fish them. In these cases, the fishers were reimbursed for the cost of the licence <span class="citation">(Government of Canada 2014)</span>, but not for any extra costs or the lost income of the fishery. In this case, the cost of reimbursement for the licences for the 2019 season is expected to be a maximum of 1,256,360 (assuming that all licences are full fee, which gives a maximum value rather than the true value).</p>
<p>For a temporary closure, the government could act in ways that is has in the past when extenuating circumstances warrant a closure of a fishery. In this case, the compensation that fishers receive is closely in line with what fishers receive for employment insurance payments <span class="citation">(Emery 1992; CBC News 2007)</span>. These payments take into account the regional rate of unemployment, earnings from fishing, earnings from other activities, and a predetermined allowed maximum weekly amount <span class="citation">(Government of Canada 2019)</span>. The maximum weekly amount in 2019 is $1,021 a week <span class="citation">(Government of Canada 2019)</span>. If a fisher’s total weekly earnings was less than this, they would use that amount in its place. The amount paid is 55% of the lower of the two numbers, thus making the maximum amount paid per fisher $562. As we determined the full-time equivalent contribution of the roe herring fishers in the Strait of Georgia and the processing jobs they generate, we can use these FTEs and the maximum weekly amount paid to compensate for the loss of this fishery to fishers and processors as has been done with other fishery closures <span class="citation">(Emery 1992)</span>. Therefore, the cost of income supplements for a temporary closure of the fishery is estimated to be $175,344.</p>
<p>Licenses are retired in fisheries to reduce capacity to a more ecologically or economically sustainable level, or to permanently close the fishery. The roe herring fishery is a limited entry licence fishery similar to the Pacific salmon fisheries in BC. Therefore, we can use the salmon fishery licence buybacks as an option for this fishery if there are believed to be benefits from reducing capacity. From 1996 to 2000, 1,406 salmon licences (34% of licenses in 1996) were retired at a total cost of $195 million dollars (~$138,000 per licence). As the roe herring licences are at a near all-time low cost, it would likely be less expensive to remove these licenses and there are less licenses to begin with in the fishery (total roe herring licenses of 1,475). In addition, the average seine herring license is valued at approximately $50,000 and the average gillnet herring licence is valued at $25,000. Therefore, the cost of retiring these licenses would likely be less than it was for salmon. The effectiveness of a licene retirement program is predicated on the limiting of expansion of effort in the remaining fleet. Therefore, a licence retirment program would not be successful without additional caps on fishing capacity and effort.</p>
<p>These strategies may not fully consider the potential strategic importance of the fishery. The herring fishery may be of particular strategic importance as it is a fishing and processing activity that occurs at an off-peak time of year for the fishing industry, and keeps income flowing to keep people employed closer to year-round. This may be especially important for the administrative side of the industry and provides additional weeks of employment to fishers and processors <span class="citation">(GSGislason &amp; Associates Ltd. 2015)</span>. Without these additional weeks, the increased precariousness of employment could lead to higher turnover of staff.</p>
