abstract = {Proposal To seek Governor in Council approval to remit {\$}93,750 in funds collected in respect of roe herring fishing licences for the 2014 fishing season, pursuant to subsection 23(2.1) of the Financial Administration Act (FAA). Objective The purpose of the Order in Council is to remit {\$}93,750 in certain annual commercial fishing licence fees for roe herring that were paid in respect of the 2014 fishing season, pursuant to subsection 19(1) of the Pacific Fishery Regulations, 1993, and that are set out in subsections 3(9) and (10) of Part I of Schedule II to those Regulations. Background The West Coast of Vancouver Island (WCVI) is one of five stock areas for the commercial herring fishery in British Columbia. This area has been closed to general commercial herring fishing since 2006 due to conservation reasons. However, on December 23, 2013, the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans made a decision to allow for the opening of the 2014 WCVI commercial herring fishery. In 2014, there were 1 267 roe herring gillnet and 252 roe herring seine licenses issued for five herring stock fishing areas, including the WCVI. These licences are renewed on January 1 every year. In this current situation, licence holders had paid their annual fees in January 2014 and completed area selection on February 5, 2014. Licence issuance for roe herring licences was delayed and occurred from February 18 to 20, 2014. On February 12, 2014, the Ahousaht, Ehattesaht, Hesquiaht, Mowachaht/Muchalaht and Tla-o-qui-aht First Nations filed a motion for an interlocutory injunction to prohibit the opening of a commercial roe herring fishery on the WCVI. On February 21, 2014, the Federal Court granted an interlocutory injunction prohibiting the opening of the 2014 commercial roe herring fishery on the WCVI pending the hearing of a judicial review application brought by the five aforementioned First Nations. As a result of the interlocutory injunction, the commercial roe herring fishery on the WCVI remained closed in 2014, and holders of commercial licences to fish for roe herring on the WCVI were unable to fish in that area in 2014. As a result, the licence holders of 23 gillnet and 25 seine licences, which had been paid for and were issued for the WCVI roe herring fishing area, were no longer able to use them. Remission is recommended on the basis that it is in the public interest to refund the licence fees to the affected licence holders. Retention of the licence fees would be contrary to the public interest, as it would unfairly disadvantage (financially) the licence holders who paid the necessary fees to fish for roe herring on the WCVI, but who were then subsequently unable to fish as a result of the interlocutory injunction granted by the Federal Court. This was a circumstance beyond the control of the licence holders. Implications The licence fees, representing a total amount of {\$}93,750, will be reimbursed to the affected licence holders.

abstract = {In salmonid aquaculture, a variety of technologies have been deployed that attempt to limit a range of environmental impacts associated with net-pen culture. One such technology employs a floating, solid-walled enclosure as the primary culture environment, providing greater potential control over negative interactions with surroundings waters while limiting energy use required for water circulation, thermo-regulation and supplemental oxygen provision. Here, we utilize life cycle assessment to model contributions to a suite of global-scale resource depletion and environmental concerns (including global warming potential, acidification potential, marine eutrophication potential, cumulative energy use, and biotic resource use) of such a technology deployed commercially to rear Chinook salmon in coastal British Columbia, Canada. Results indicate that at full grow-out, feed provisioning and on-site energy use dominate contributions across four of five impact categories assessed. For example, per tonne of salmon harvested, feed contributed approximately 72{\%} to global warming potential, 72{\%} to acidification potential, and accounted for 100{\%} of biotic resource use. However, for both feed and on-site energy use, impacts are heavily influenced by specific sources of inputs; therefore efforts to improve the environmental performance of this technology should focus on reducing these in favor of less impactful alternatives.},

There is a growing dependence on market-based approaches that in turn rely on healthy, functioning markets to achieve economic outcomes. As well, social goals of equity and fairness in fisheries have re-emerged as priorities alongside the goals of ecological sustainability and economic efficiency. This study aims to address the past and present state of the concentration of fishing licenses in British Columbia's salmon and herring fisheries. Fisheries administrative data from federal and provincial data sets were mined to develop a timeline of fisheries ownership and control over a twenty-year period. Hidden corporate ownership of licenses through subsidiaries was identified and comprehensive criteria were co-identified with industry representatives to characterize the various user groups of fisheries licenses. Our analysis suggests that from 1993 to 2012, there was a notable shift in the ownership profile of salmon and herring licenses, with a marked increase in concentration of licenses owned by fish processors.},

The depth and quality of data upon which valuations are based varies dramatically by fishery – some fisheries are active, with ample vessel and licence transactions, while others are very closely held. For fisheries with very limited vessel/licence markets, valuations are based more on inference and anecdotal information than on hard data. This is reflected in the reported “confidence level” of each assessment. This report provides by-fishery analysis of current and historical licence, quota, lease, and vessel values. The findings of this report are offered with the objective to provide information across fisheries on a consistent basis.

Specifically, we report the cumulative energy use, biotic resource use, and greenhouse gas, acidifying, and eutrophying emissions associated with producing farmed salmon in Norway, the UK, British Columbia (Canada), and Chile, as well as a production-weighted global average. We found marked differences in the nature and quantity of material/energy resource use and associated emissions per unit production across regions. This suggests significant scope for improved environmental performance in the industry as a whole. We identify key leverage points for improving performance, most notably the critical importance of least-environmental cost feed sourcing patterns and continued improvements in feed conversion efficiency. Overall, impacts were lowest for Norwegian production in most impact categories, and highest for UK farmed salmon. Our results are of direct relevance to industry, policy makers, eco-labeling programs, and consumers seeking to further sustainability objectives in salmon aquaculture.},

Weak sustainability is within neo-classical economic theory and believes manufactured and human capital are perfectly substitutable for natural capital; in addition, technology will solve any sustainability problems of the future. Strong sustainability does not believe natural capital is substitutable and eco-efficient technologies must be used to make the most of the remaining natural capital. Contrasting views of seeing the economy within or separate from the ecosphere. 
Critical compenent of critical natural capital, and irreversibility of some actions (extinction). 
Biophysical assessment techniques
Economic analysis is limited because of a lack of ecosystems goods and services being integrated into markets, and not being valuated properly. Energy analysis became more popular after 1970s oil crisis and energy started to be considered more highly. Oil must also be considered for its environmental effects. Energy is also obtained readily from solar flows that have now been quantified, and goods can now be evaluated on their emergy content based on solar flows. Material throughput systems like MIPS and environmental space have also been developed to show the amount of materials or productive land needed to yield a product. GHG emission intensity has also been developed based on energy analysis, which includes non-fuel related GHGs which can be very important (cows). Carrying capacity is the basis of ecological footprint analysis. Measures material and energy flows required to sustain a human population in ecosystem area. Has been used to evaluate alternative production systems for similar products. 




Chapter 3:
EFA- Material, labour and energy inputs and outputs were quantified and converted into marine and terrestrial ecosystem support areas. 
You didn't account for wastes from salmon farms, discards and bytcatch, antibiotics and pesticides.
Why is it we err on the side of conservative estimates and risk not knowing the full impact of our activities?
EF- Calculated based on energy efficiency and ability to do work after, as well as EROI ratios between feeding salmon, or catching salmon and energy they are able to do after.},
